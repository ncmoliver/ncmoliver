- ⚡ Fun fact: While playing overseas basketball, I utilized my free time to learn programming languages through Udemy, gaining experience in Python, JavaScript, EJS, JSX, and React. This prepared me to join the AI bootcamp at UNC Chapel Hill, where I am now focused on pursuing an entry-level data analyst role..
